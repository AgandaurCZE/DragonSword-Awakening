## 2026-10-28 — Restore full-frame Roxy, Ornette and Reina portraits
- Replaced `assets/heroes/roxy.webp`, `assets/heroes/ornette.webp`, and `assets/heroes/reina.webp` using the original supplied character-card artwork, retaining each decorative frame, archetype emblem, and character name instead of the cropped portrait-only versions.
- Kept all existing portrait paths and `data.json` connections unchanged. Encoded the recovered artwork as WebP at the original card aspect ratios for the existing card and profile layouts.
- Validation: recovered and inspected the three original uploads, checked their image dimensions, verified the portrait paths in `data.json`, and prepared valid WebP replacements. Live browser rendering has not been tested in this session.
